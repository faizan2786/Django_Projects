# Django_Projects
This repo contains my personal projects for creating web applications using Python's Django framework.

## CS50 Directory
This folder contains web apps taught in ["CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) online course - mainly in Lecture 3 and 4! 
Currently there are 3 web-apps as below:
- **firstapp**: A "Hello World" Django app "greet" page which greets the user with provided name in the url.
- **newyear**: Displays "YES" or "NO" if today's date is new year or not.
- **todo**: A simple to-do list app which allows users to add and view tasks as a list -> This app demonstrates slight advanced usage of Django framework ***(i.e. views and templates)*** to create web-apps.
- **flights**: A flight app which shows list of flights and also shows detailed info of each flight -> This app demonstrates the usage of sqlite database using ***django models*** - an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) feature of django to manipulate underlying database tables using python objects
