#JavaScript

JavaScript **(JS)** is a programming language specially used for **client side dynamic rendering** of web pages. JS is one of the fundamental technology used for modern web-development. 

Recently, JS has also become very popular to develop backend web-applications since the introduction of server-side JavaScript run-time framework known as [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js). This makes JS a *go-to language for web-developers* which enables them to develope both front-end and back-end applications using a single programming language!
